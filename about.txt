->256-bit key and 128-bit IV gievn as input in the program.

->The program generates 128-bit keystream for one cycle.
->The length of the keystream can be increased up to 100 Mb or more by increasing the cycles.
->The keystream generated for one cycle is then taken as the IV for next cycle.

->The output is stored in a file "output.txt".

Steps to run the program:
1)Copy the program-main to any C-compatible editor and run the code.
  The output generated is copied to any filename specified in the program.'
or
2) Run the code on terminal by giving the commad:
   -> gcc filename.c
   ->./a.out
